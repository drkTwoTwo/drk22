    <h2>Analyzing the Binary</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Downloading the Binary</h3>
    <p>
        First, I downloaded the binary and checked its file type using the <code>file</code> command.

    <h3>Step 2: Inspecting the File</h3>
    <p>
        The output revealed that it was a <strong>statically linked ELF binary</strong>, meaning all necessary libraries are included within the binary itself.
        However, upon closer inspection, I noticed the binary lacked section headers, which made it challenging to analyze initially.

    <h3>Step 3: Checking Strings</h3>
    <p>
        Next, I used the <code>strings</code> command on the binary. This revealed that the binary was packed using the <strong>UPX packer</strong>.
        UPX (Ultimate Packer for Executables) compresses binaries and includes decompression stubs to restore them during execution.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 4: Initial Debugging</h3>
    <p>
        I loaded the binary into <code>gdb</code>, but due to the UPX compression, I couldn't retrieve any valuable information. At this stage, the packed binary was still obfuscated.

    <h3>Step 5: Unpacking the Binary</h3>
    <p>
        After some research, I discovered that UPX offers a built-in unpacking feature. Using the <code>upx</code> package, I unpacked the binary with the following command:
    </p>
    <pre><code>upx -d &lt;binary_name&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>
        This process successfully restored the binary's section headers, making it much easier to analyze.

    <h3>Step 6: Decompiling with Binary Ninja</h3>
    <p>
        I loaded the unpacked binary into <strong>Binary Ninja</strong> for detailed analysis. During this step, I discovered a long string embedded in the binary.

    <h3>Step 7: Extracting the Flag</h3>
    <p>
        The string appeared to be encoded, so I used <strong>CyberChef</strong> to decode it. After decoding, I found the flag:
    </p>
    <p><strong>Flag:</strong> <code>picoCTF{U9X_UnP4ck1N6_B1n4Ri3S_e190c3f3}</code></p>

    <p>This writeup documents the process I followed to unpack and analyze the binary, eventually retrieving the flag. It demonstrates how useful tools like <code>upx</code>, <strong>Binary Ninja</strong>, and <strong>CyberChef</strong> can be in binary exploitation tasks.</p>
